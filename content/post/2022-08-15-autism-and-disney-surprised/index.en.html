<p>The little things.</p>
<p>Mark</p>
<p>Well, the biggest thing that I got.</p>
<p>Mark</p>
<p>That you told me about Disney was and I wrote it down, remember?</p>
<p>Mark</p>
<p>He said these people.</p>
<p>Mark</p>
<p>Have their day every day of the week, every day of the year.</p>
<p>Mark</p>
<p>They basically have it easy.</p>
<p>Mark</p>
<p>You you have it very hard because you have to work with two kids that are disabled with autism.</p>
<p>Mark</p>
<p>So like getting all those like perks at Disney is like you know the one thing they can have that other people can’t.</p>
<p>Mark</p>
<p>It’s an interesting way to look at it.</p>
<p>Mark</p>
<p>Don’t you think?</p>
<p>Liz</p>
<p>It’s not just for me though.</p>
<p>Liz</p>
<p>It’s about the kids too, like.</p>
<p>Liz</p>
<p>My oldest everything is harder for her.</p>
<p>Liz</p>
<p>You know, everyday life is hard for her just getting up and trying to get dressed in the morning is.</p>
<p>Liz</p>
<p>Hard for her.</p>
<p>Liz</p>
<p>Yeah, so it’s not just about the parents.</p>
<p>Liz</p>
<p>Well, I mean, ’cause that’s what I felt like.</p>
<p>Liz</p>
<p>I felt like people were staring at us at Disney like oh look at them.</p>
<p>Liz</p>
<p>They’re just going through the handicap ramp and their kids can walk or whatever, you know.</p>
<p>Liz</p>
<p>Or the way people.</p>
<p>Liz</p>
<p>Look at you and.</p>
<p>Mark</p>
<p>I thought about that a lot too.</p>
<p>Mark</p>
<p>I thought like like people are saying.</p>
<p>Mark</p>
<p>Like, well, how handicapped are they like?</p>
<p>Mark</p>
<p>Are they really that handicapped?</p>
<p>Mark</p>
<p>Honestly though, I kind of ignored a lot of it and didn’t care that much because well, mostly because I’ve been working.</p>
<p>Mark</p>
<p>With you with the kids for.</p>
<p>Mark</p>
<p>Like nine months now like I.</p>
<p>Mark</p>
<p>Know that they have issues.</p>
<p>Mark</p>
<p>And then one thing that you said.</p>
<p>Mark</p>
<p>That like I kind of thought about in my head, was ’cause you said, Oh well, they can’t wait in line.</p>
<p>Mark</p>
<p>But I thought in my head I said what kid can right?</p>
<p>Mark</p>
<p>So even I was judgmental on like.</p>
<p>Mark</p>
<p>That aspect of it like oh they, they can’t wait in line like when I was a kid I could not wait in line.</p>
<p>Mark</p>
<p>I’d be running back and forth.</p>
<p>Mark</p>
<p>My mother would have to save my spot or something, you know.</p>
<p>Mark</p>
<p>If I went to a Disney or something like that, so like there’s that, but I mean I get it like they’re even.</p>
<p>Mark</p>
<p>Like more.</p>
<p>Mark</p>
<p>Out of touch with trying to wait in line.</p>
<p>Mark</p>
<p>But also we did have the grandparents that kinda.</p>
<p>Mark</p>
<p>Push the issue as well and they get everything it can like there is.</p>
<p>Mark</p>
<p>My kid can’t wait in line.</p>
<p>Mark</p>
<p>Then there’s my kid.</p>
<p>Mark</p>
<p>Can’t wait in line and I have to be in the shortest.</p>
<p>Mark</p>
<p>Line, and it’s basically like in a wheelchair.</p>
<p>Liz</p>
<p>Brooklyn also has seizures which are greatly exacerbated by the heat so long we’re in line and outside, especially when the lines are in the sun.</p>
<p>Liz</p>
<p>That’s also a bad struggle for her.</p>
<p>Liz</p>
<p>She also loses sight of what we’re waiting in line for, because she can’t always process everything.</p>
<p>Liz</p>
<p>So while we’re waiting in line, she’s also not just waiting in line.</p>
<p>Liz</p>
<p>She’s trying to process.</p>
<p>Liz</p>
<p>All the things that our brain just kind of processes in the background almost like my brain processes the noise.</p>
<p>Liz</p>
<p>All the other people talking line, the.</p>
<p>Liz</p>
<p>Stroller wheel the lady yapping behind us the you know, clickety clack of some ride noise and we don’t even realize it.</p>
<p>Liz</p>
<p>But kids with autism, all of that is in the like the forefront of their brain or whatever.</p>
<p>Liz</p>
<p>It’s it’s right up in front.</p>
<p>Liz</p>
<p>They they hear it all.</p>
<p>Liz</p>
<p>They see it all and they process it all at one time they can’t.</p>
<p>Liz</p>
<p>Sort it out.</p>
<p>Liz</p>
<p>And so all of that input is coming in at the same time.</p>
<p>Mark</p>
<p>Well, they certainly put some hours in this last week, but yeah, I can understand like she doesn’t even realize.</p>
<p>Mark</p>
<p>Well, she does realize that I think like for the most part, like I’m in line for this ride, you know.</p>
<p>Mark</p>
<p>I mean, she knows why she’s in line.</p>
<p>Mark</p>
<p>You know?</p>
<p>Liz</p>
<p>But then it gets to be the point where.</p>
<p>Liz</p>
<p>I’m trying to process all of this around me.</p>
<p>Liz</p>
<p>Is it worth standing here for that long to ride this ride?</p>
<p>Liz</p>
<p>And for her it becomes so overwhelming that it’s not worth it anymore.</p>
<p>Mark</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean I didn’t feel bad.</p>
<p>Mark</p>
<p>Uhm, because</p>
<p>Mark</p>
<p>Of a lot of reasons, but another reason was you are also a single mom, basically so like it’s even harder, so it’s like take all the perks.</p>
<p>Mark</p>
<p>You can get.</p>
<p>Mark</p>
<p>And then you know then we hear about that other lady at the hot tub that says anybody can get that.</p>
<p>Mark</p>
<p>You just go up there and say you can’t wait in lines.</p>
<p>Mark</p>
<p>They they can’t ask questions.</p>
<p>Mark</p>
<p>Think about that kind of.</p>
<p>Mark</p>
<p>****** you off a little bit.</p>
<p>Liz</p>
<p>It did ’cause like.</p>
<p>Liz</p>
<p>So somebody that that is capable of waiting in line is telling you know something else.</p>
<p>Liz</p>
<p>So you just go do this because you don’t want to wait in line be hot.</p>
<p>Liz</p>
<p>Where my kids actually truly have.</p>
<p>Liz</p>
<p>Some issues of waiting in line and they can’t get hot or she will get a seizure and she also has a lot of you know, muscular issues where waiting in line can be hardware.</p>
<p>Liz</p>
<p>Her calf and her.</p>
<p>Liz</p>
<p>Uhm, ankles and stuff like seize up and.</p>
<p>Liz</p>
<p>She ’cause she.</p>
<p>Liz</p>
<p>Pops up on her toes a lot.</p>
<p>Liz</p>
<p>And that’s why she has to be in a stroller, ’cause she can’t do a ton of walking.</p>
<p>Liz</p>
<p>So yeah, when somebody says oh, just go do that.</p>
<p>Liz</p>
<p>You know everybody does it.</p>
<p>Liz</p>
<p>It is slightly, you know.</p>
<p>Mark</p>
<p>Well, it’s funny ’cause it’s like well not funny but like my brother, he’s in a wheelchair.</p>
<p>Mark</p>
<p>He doesn’t even have a handicap placard.</p>
<p>Mark</p>
<p>He doesn’t ever park in handicap, but he has to get out.</p>
<p>Mark</p>
<p>He does park there, don’t get me wrong illegally.</p>
<p>Mark</p>
<p>Once in a while, but for the most part, nobody does.</p>
<p>Mark</p>
<p>Like if I’m driving with him, nobody ever does.</p>
<p>Mark</p>
<p>We park in the very far back so.</p>
<p>Mark</p>
<p>We have all the room we can get to get out.</p>
<p>Mark</p>
<p>But it is funny when it when you it is funny when.</p>
<p>Mark</p>
<p>You see people.</p>
<p>Mark</p>
<p>That don’t look like their handicap get out.</p>
<p>Mark</p>
<p>But since I’m wise, wiser than some, I know that it doesn’t matter. Like if you have Crohn’s disease or if you have something that doesn’t show or it’s not 100% all the time.</p>
<p>Mark</p>
<p>You know, but it could happen at any second.</p>
<p>Mark</p>
<p>You know you.</p>
<p>Mark</p>
<p>Could look like.</p>
<p>Mark</p>
<p>I have very capable 20 year old.</p>
<p>Mark</p>
<p>Jumping out of a handicap section and you can judge, or you can realize that like that 20 year old has spasms in.</p>
<p>Mark</p>
<p>Its spinal cord.</p>
<p>Mark</p>
<p>Every who knows when and then it cripples them and they can’t get back to their car.</p>
<p>Mark</p>
<p>I don’t know, I’m just saying it, you can’t prejudge anybody.</p>
<p>Liz</p>
<p>Yeah, with Brooklyn diagnosis.</p>
<p>Liz</p>
<p>Uhm, because of her seizures and she can’t walk through.</p>
<p>Liz</p>
<p>I can also get a handicap placard for her.</p>
<p>Liz</p>
<p>I can also get a handicap placard for myself because I have Ms. </p>
<p>Liz</p>
<p>I can get one hand sounds super easy, I just have to go and fill out the paperwork, but I never have ’cause I feel.</p>
<p>Liz</p>
<p>You know somebody else might need that space more than I do.</p>
<p>Liz</p>
<p>I can right now walk.</p>
<p>Liz</p>
<p>Still that far but.</p>
<p>Mark</p>
<p>Yeah, fortunately.</p>
<p>Liz</p>
<p>And the one day when when I do need it, and you know there has been times in my past where I have been in a wheelchair and I have needed it.</p>
<p>Liz</p>
<p>And you know sometimes it’s not available, and so I never want to take advantage of the system and use it when I don’t need it, because when I do.</p>
<p>Liz</p>
<p>Need it.</p>
<p>Liz</p>
<p>I want it to be available for me and I don’t want.</p>
<p>Liz</p>
<p>Somebody else to be parking there who doesn’t need it?</p>
<p>Mark</p>
<p>Yeah, one thing.</p>
<p>Mark</p>
<p>One good thing I could say about Disney ’cause I’m not a Disney person as you figure it out and you knew ahead of time, but they do cater to disabled like very much so.</p>
<p>Mark</p>
<p>And that’s actually pretty awesome, because like you said it is there one place that they can go where they have the.</p>
<p>Mark</p>
<p>Like they did a really good job though.</p>
<p>Mark</p>
<p>Every single one of them, right?</p>
<p>Mark</p>
<p>I mean.</p>
<p>Liz</p>
<p>Oh, I agree, hands down Disney really does cater to, you know disabled people.</p>
<p>Liz</p>
<p>I mean they try and make it.</p>
<p>Liz</p>
<p>They say a magical experience for everybody.</p>
<p>Liz</p>
<p>You know.</p>
<p>Liz</p>
<p>They really made it a magical experience for my girls.</p>
<p>Mark</p>
<p>Yeah that was I mean I was very.</p>
<p>Mark</p>
<p>Impressed with that.</p>
<p>Mark</p>
<p>The customer service on that aspect was unreal.</p>
<p>Mark</p>
<p>So anyways.</p>
<p>Mark</p>
<p>This was our.</p>
<p>Mark</p>
<p>Test trial.</p>
