Transcript 

 Mark 

The little things. 

 Mark 

Well, the biggest thing that I got. 

 Mark 

That you told me about Disney was and I wrote it down, remember? 

 Mark 

He said these people. 

 Mark 

Have their day every day of the week, every day of the year. 

 Mark 

They basically have it easy. 

 Mark 

You you have it very hard because you have to work with two kids that are disabled with autism. 

 Mark 

So like getting all those like perks at Disney is like you know the one thing they can have that other people can't. 

 Mark 

It's an interesting way to look at it. 

 Mark 

Don't you think? 

 Liz 

It's not just for me though. 

 Liz 

It's about the kids too, like. 

 Liz 

My oldest everything is harder for her. 

 Liz 

You know, everyday life is hard for her just getting up and trying to get dressed in the morning is. 

 Liz 

Hard for her. 

 Liz 

Yeah, so it's not just about the parents. 

 Liz 

Well, I mean, 'cause that's what I felt like. 

 Liz 

I felt like people were staring at us at Disney like oh look at them. 

 Liz 

They're just going through the handicap ramp and their kids can walk or whatever, you know. 

 Liz 

Or the way people. 

 Liz 

Look at you and. 

 Mark 

I thought about that a lot too. 

 Mark 

I thought like like people are saying. 

 Mark 

Like, well, how handicapped are they like? 

 Mark 

Are they really that handicapped? 

 Mark 

Honestly though, I kind of ignored a lot of it and didn't care that much because well, mostly because I've been working. 

 Mark 

With you with the kids for. 

 Mark 

Like nine months now like I. 

 Mark 

Know that they have issues. 

 Mark 

And then one thing that you said. 

 Mark 

That like I kind of thought about in my head, was 'cause you said, Oh well, they can't wait in line. 

 Mark 

But I thought in my head I said what kid can right? 

 Mark 

So even I was judgmental on like. 

 Mark 

That aspect of it like oh they, they can't wait in line like when I was a kid I could not wait in line. 

 Mark 

I'd be running back and forth. 

 Mark 

My mother would have to save my spot or something, you know. 

 Mark 

If I went to a Disney or something like that, so like there's that, but I mean I get it like they're even. 

 Mark 

Like more. 

 Mark 

Out of touch with trying to wait in line. 

 Mark 

But also we did have the grandparents that kinda. 

 Mark 

Push the issue as well and they get everything it can like there is. 

 Mark 

My kid can't wait in line. 

 Mark 

Then there's my kid. 

 Mark 

Can't wait in line and I have to be in the shortest. 

 Mark 

Line, and it's basically like in a wheelchair. 

 Liz 

Brooklyn also has seizures which are greatly exacerbated by the heat so long we're in line and outside, especially when the lines are in the sun. 

 Liz 

That's also a bad struggle for her. 

 Liz 

She also loses sight of what we're waiting in line for, because she can't always process everything. 

 Liz 

So while we're waiting in line, she's also not just waiting in line. 

 Liz 

She's trying to process. 

 Liz 

All the things that our brain just kind of processes in the background almost like my brain processes the noise. 

 Liz 

All the other people talking line, the. 

 Liz 

Stroller wheel the lady yapping behind us the you know, clickety clack of some ride noise and we don't even realize it. 

 Liz 

But kids with autism, all of that is in the like the forefront of their brain or whatever. 

 Liz 

It's it's right up in front. 

 Liz 

They they hear it all. 

 Liz 

They see it all and they process it all at one time they can't. 

 Liz 

Sort it out. 

 Liz 

And so all of that input is coming in at the same time. 

 Mark 

Well, they certainly put some hours in this last week, but yeah, I can understand like she doesn't even realize. 

 Mark 

Well, she does realize that I think like for the most part, like I'm in line for this ride, you know. 

 Mark 

I mean, she knows why she's in line. 

 Mark 

You know? 

 Liz 

But then it gets to be the point where. 

 Liz 

I'm trying to process all of this around me. 

 Liz 

Is it worth standing here for that long to ride this ride? 

 Liz 

And for her it becomes so overwhelming that it's not worth it anymore. 

 Mark 

Yeah, I mean I didn't feel bad. 

 Mark 

Uhm, because 

 Mark 

Of a lot of reasons, but another reason was you are also a single mom, basically so like it's even harder, so it's like take all the perks. 

 Mark 

You can get. 

 Mark 

And then you know then we hear about that other lady at the hot tub that says anybody can get that. 

 Mark 

You just go up there and say you can't wait in lines. 

 Mark 

They they can't ask questions. 

 Mark 

Think about that kind of. 

 Mark 

****** you off a little bit. 

 Liz 

It did 'cause like. 

 Liz 

So somebody that that is capable of waiting in line is telling you know something else. 

 Liz 

So you just go do this because you don't want to wait in line be hot. 

 Liz 

Where my kids actually truly have. 

 Liz 

Some issues of waiting in line and they can't get hot or she will get a seizure and she also has a lot of you know, muscular issues where waiting in line can be hardware. 

 Liz 

Her calf and her. 

 Liz 

Uhm, ankles and stuff like seize up and. 

 Liz 

She 'cause she. 

 Liz 

Pops up on her toes a lot. 

 Liz 

And that's why she has to be in a stroller, 'cause she can't do a ton of walking. 

 Liz 

So yeah, when somebody says oh, just go do that. 

 Liz 

You know everybody does it. 

 Liz 

It is slightly, you know. 

 Mark 

Well, it's funny 'cause it's like well not funny but like my brother, he's in a wheelchair. 

 Mark 

He doesn't even have a handicap placard. 

 Mark 

He doesn't ever park in handicap, but he has to get out. 

 Mark 

He does park there, don't get me wrong illegally. 

 Mark 

Once in a while, but for the most part, nobody does. 

 Mark 

Like if I'm driving with him, nobody ever does. 

 Mark 

We park in the very far back so. 

 Mark 

We have all the room we can get to get out. 

 Mark 

But it is funny when it when you it is funny when. 

 Mark 

You see people. 

 Mark 

That don't look like their handicap get out. 

 Mark 

But since I'm wise, wiser than some, I know that it doesn't matter. Like if you have Crohn's disease or if you have something that doesn't show or it's not 100% all the time. 

 Mark 

You know, but it could happen at any second. 

 Mark 

You know you. 

 Mark 

Could look like. 

 Mark 

I have very capable 20 year old. 

 Mark 

Jumping out of a handicap section and you can judge, or you can realize that like that 20 year old has spasms in. 

 Mark 

Its spinal cord. 

 Mark 

Every who knows when and then it cripples them and they can't get back to their car. 

 Mark 

I don't know, I'm just saying it, you can't prejudge anybody. 

 Liz 

Yeah, with Brooklyn diagnosis. 

 Liz 

Uhm, because of her seizures and she can't walk through. 

 Liz 

I can also get a handicap placard for her. 

 Liz 

I can also get a handicap placard for myself because I have Ms. 

 Liz 

I can get one hand sounds super easy, I just have to go and fill out the paperwork, but I never have 'cause I feel. 

 Liz 

You know somebody else might need that space more than I do. 

 Liz 

I can right now walk. 

 Liz 

Still that far but. 

 Mark 

Yeah, fortunately. 

 Liz 

And the one day when when I do need it, and you know there has been times in my past where I have been in a wheelchair and I have needed it. 

 Liz 

And you know sometimes it's not available, and so I never want to take advantage of the system and use it when I don't need it, because when I do. 

 Liz 

Need it. 

 Liz 

I want it to be available for me and I don't want. 

 Liz 

Somebody else to be parking there who doesn't need it? 

 Mark 

Yeah, one thing. 

 Mark 

One good thing I could say about Disney 'cause I'm not a Disney person as you figure it out and you knew ahead of time, but they do cater to disabled like very much so. 

 Mark 

And that's actually pretty awesome, because like you said it is there one place that they can go where they have the. 

 Mark 

Like they did a really good job though. 

 Mark 

Every single one of them, right? 

 Mark 

I mean. 

 Liz 

Oh, I agree, hands down Disney really does cater to, you know disabled people. 

 Liz 

I mean they try and make it. 

 Liz 

They say a magical experience for everybody. 

 Liz 

You know. 

 Liz 

They really made it a magical experience for my girls. 

 Mark 

Yeah that was I mean I was very. 

 Mark 

Impressed with that. 

 Mark 

The customer service on that aspect was unreal. 

 Mark 

So anyways. 

 Mark 

This was our. 

 Mark 

Test trial.
