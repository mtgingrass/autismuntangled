<h1>Camping with Autistic Kids: How to break down the steps and ensure a great experience</h1>
<p>My first camping trip with Liz and her kids on the spectrum was a great
experience. Unfortunately, some parents forego the outdoorsy
camping-type trips altogether because it could mean disaster.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>How do you keep the kids entertained?</p></li>
<li><p>How do you get them used to the idea of sleeping in a tent?</p></li>
<li><p>How do you make sure they feel safe?</p></li>
<li><p>How do you keep their senses in order?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This short article will detail my observations and conversations with
Liz on how she prepped her children with autism for the great outdoors.
We traveled four hours to the Table Rock Campgrounds in South Carolina,
tent camped, and hiked over three miles with a seven and nine-year-old
on the spectrum.</p>
<p>Read on so that you can enjoy the great outdoors with your children,
too.</p>
